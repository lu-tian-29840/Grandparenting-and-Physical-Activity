# Code for Grandparenting and Physical Activity

This repository contains Stata scripts that reproduce analyses for the project **Grandparenting and Physical Activity**. The code is organized into two scripts that should be run in sequence: :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

1. **1_Preparation_and_Modeling.do** – prepares the analysis dataset (constructs exposure, outcomes, and covariates) and fits the primary models. 
2. **2_Sensitivity analysis.do** – runs pre-specified robustness checks (alternative definitions, sample restrictions, and model forms) and saves supplemental outputs. 

As with your other repo, this README follows the same concise structure and “run-in-order” script list. :contentReference

## Software
- **Stata** 15 or newer (SE/MP recommended for larger survey files).

## Data
Original survey data are **not** included. Supply the required files locally in the paths referenced by the scripts before execution.
